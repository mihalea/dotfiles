# dotfiles

After spending many hours customizing Arch Linux to my liking I thought that it would be a shame to lose all that work or pass it around on a spare flash drive. Therefore through the use of git and Gnu Stow I have devised a method of keeping track of all this files, making reinstalls hassle free.

Some reliable sources of information that have helped me through the conquest of GNU/Linux are [the ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and [forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/), [the i3 docs](http://i3wm.org/docs/), [github](https://github.com/) for numerous examples, and many other documentation websites.
